Q2) Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?
A2) In overloading method name is same but parameters are always different while in overriding method name and parameter
also same.
in overloading it may need or don't need inheritance.but in overriding inheritance is needed to it can take property from
their super class
overloading is static polymorphism and overriding is dynamic polymorphism.
overloading method runs at a runtime while overriding method run at a compile time.
ex-for overload
1) public class sum{
     int add(int a,int b){
     return a+b
     }
     int add(int a,int b,int c){
          return a+b+c
          }
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(add(5,6); //execute first add method
            System.out.println(add(2,3,4)); //execute second add method
          }
}
ex- for over ride

2) class animal{
  void eat(){
    System.out.println("animal super class);
}
}
class lion extends animal{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     lion l1=new lion();
     l1.eat();
     //it will gives output as "animal super class"
   }
}
class lion extends animal{
     void eat(){
     System.out.println("lion class inside animal")
     }
   public static void main(String[] args) {

     lion l1=new lion();
     l1.eat();
     //it will gives output as "lion class inside animal"
   }
}
